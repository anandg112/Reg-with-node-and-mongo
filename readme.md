## User Registration validation with NodeJS and MongoDB

### Change into project directory and run the command below to install required node modules

### Run the command below to start web server and the app

Use MongoDB Compass (GUI for DB) to check if the user has been successfully registered and data persists on DB. Connect to localhost on port 27017. Or uncomment the following line (33) in ```server.js``` to see the user registered on command prompt.

```
console.log(user);
```
